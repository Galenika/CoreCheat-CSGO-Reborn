# Updater System
- Updater system is based on Github s release system.
- Used [Lufzys/Github.NET](https://github.com/Lufzys/Github.NET "Lufzys/Github.NET") for grabbing data from github and made an update system.
- It automaticly downloads the new version and extracting file from .zip . Adter extracting run automaticly. Deletes the old version ofc. If you want to download again, you can just delete the core.exe and open updater. DONT FORGET! You can not open the cheat without starting from updater.
